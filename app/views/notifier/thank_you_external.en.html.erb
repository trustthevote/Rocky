Dear <%= @registrant.first_name %>,<br><br>

Thank you for using <%= @registrant.rtv_and_partner_name.to_s.html_safe %>'s online voter registration tool.<br><br>

If you completed a voter registration application online, it was submitted to the  <%= @registrant.home_state_name.to_s.html_safe %> Secretary of State Office for processing. Once approved, you'll receive a confirmation from the <%= @registrant.home_state_abbrev.to_s.html_safe %> Secretary of State Office and your county elections department will put your new voter registration card in the mail.<br><br>

If you have questions or concerns, you can check the status of your voter registration by calling the <%= @registrant.home_state_abbrev.to_s.html_safe %> Secretary of State Office at <%= @registrar_phone.to_s.html_safe %>, or checking online at <%=@registrar_url.to_s.html_safe %>. Please contact <%= @registrant.rtv_and_partner_name.to_s.html_safe %> directly if you encountered any issues with the registration process.<br><br>

Now, we need your help getting others registered to vote too. There are big elections all over the country this year and 45 million eligible young voters - and we need to make sure everybody has their say. So, send an email to your family and friends or pass on the message below today.<br><br>

And, finally, don't forget to vote when Election Day rolls around. If we want politicians to pay attention to the issues we care about, we have to vote.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
Heather Smith<br>
President, Rock the Vote<br><br>
