Rocky RESTful API 
Version 2.2 - Updated
Jan 31, 2014

Release Notes

Added these interfaces:

GET /api/v2/partnerpublicprofiles/partner.json
GET /api/v2/gregistrationstates.json 
POST /api/v2/gregistration.json
GET /api/v2/gregistrations.json 

Since this addition did not modify the existing API, did not rev from v2 to v3.

Overview

Rocky is web application that provides a web user interface that U.S. citizens can use for assistance in preparing a voter registration application document that is complete and correct for all Federal and state-specific requirements, and therefore should be accepted in most cases by the election officials to whom the user submits the completed, printed, signed form.

This specification defines an application programming interface that provides exactly the same functions as the Rocky web UI, but intended for a complementary purpose: use by other web applications that have or collect personal info via their own web UI, and which rely on the Rocky back-end for data validation, error reporting (particularly for state-specific conditions), PDF generation, and data storage. Via this API, Rocky provides a web service to service clients (web applications that use this API to interact with Rocky) that are software operated by Rocky “partner organizations”. 

Partner organizations also have access to aggregated data and reporting. These are provided by the Rocky Web UI in two ways partner organization staff can use to obtain statistics and summary information: a CSV file download provides aggregated registration data for all the registrations done via that partner; and a summary web page provides statistics about this partner-specific aggregated data set. This API provides analogous bulk data extraction, with the “partner_registrations” interface that returns the same data as is provided in the web UI CSV file download.

The primary interface is this API is the “registrations” interface, in which callers provide all the personal data needed to create a person’s voter registration application form. Rocky checks the validity of each field, including state-specific validation rules. If there are errors, Rocky returns to the caller a set of error reporting on individual fields of personal data. If there are no errors, Rocky returns the URL of a PDF file that contains the validated information, properly formatted as a voter registration request form.

This API also includes an optional interface “state_requirements,” used to pre-check the user data based on location and date of birth. One intended use of the pre-check function is for cases where service clients that already know the user’s location, and perhaps also DOB. In such cases, the service client can find out from Rocky whether a user is ineligible, and if so, not even begin the web UI dialogues with the user to obtain personal information. Location ineligibility is the result of states that do not allow voter registration by mail, or do not accept Rocky-generated forms for some other reason. DOB is used to determine age ineligibility in the user’s state.

When the user is not ineligible based on location or DOB, “state_requirements” returns several kinds of state-specific information that the caller could use as part its web UI with the user -- for example, the list of political parties that user can select for affiliation, or an indication that certain fields are optional for the state, or not collected by the state. 

Finally, the API includes the “partner_registrations” interface to obtain records of past registration transactions. Like the similar UI in the Rocky Partner Portal, access requires authentication, and the records returned are only those pertinent to the authenticated entity.

Interface Definitions

All requests and responses are JSON format. All fields are required unless otherwise specified as optional. All string fields have no length or format restrictions, unless specifically stated. Some field values have specific formats; others have parenthesized notations on field values. 

registrations

Creates a new registrant record using the input parameter data; and also triggers the side effects of a new record, e.g. sending confirmation email. Most fields are personal information. A few fields merit additional description:

partner_id is a number that uniquely identifies a partner organization that uses Rocky as a service for the organization’s members or community. Each transaction is logged by partner_id and every registrant record is tagged by partner_id.
source_tracking_id is used to identify the source of a request. For example, in the Web UI, it is typically used as query parameter embedded in a URL in email messages, and identifies the request as part of a particular email campaign. The string value is un-interpreted, however, and may be used for any similar purpose
partner_tracking_id is similar, but intended for use for partner-specific purposes, such as implementing a leader-board, that may require an a tag in addition to the source_tracking_id.
id_number is typically a state driver’s license number state ID card number, or social security number; length and format vary by state, as does the explanation of what forms of ID are acceptable. However, id_number is not optional. (Note: it is true that some states’ localities will accept NVRA forms without an ID number, for the special case of people with neither state ID or an SSN. However, since we cannot record precisely how each state handles this special case, we require some ID number, to avoid creating registration requests that may be rejected.)
email_address is required, even though it is optional for the paper form; however, we need it to contact the user to send them a link to the PDF we generate for them.
opt_in_email is determined by the caller, and simply recorded in the registration record created by the call; the caller can determine whether to always obtain the info from the user, or have a default in the case of no user input. Regardless, the opt_in_email field is required to record true or false for opt-in, regardless of how the caller determined the user’s preference. This field is used to record a user preference for email from RockTheVote.
opt_in_sms is required in exactly the same way as opt_in_email.
opt_in_volunteer is required in exactly the same way as opt_in_email.
partner_opt_in_email, partner_opt_in_sms, partner_opt_in_volunteer are used in an analogous way to record user preference for communication with the partner organization.
party is optional because it is not required on the form; however, the allowable values are state specific.
some fields are required in some states, optional in others, and not recorded in others; similarly some fields have permitted values that vary by state. State-specific information is provided by other interfaces in this API.
pdfurl is an out parameter that is the URL of a PDF file containing the voter registration application form with the personal information provided in the request. 
The URL itself is a large number, large enough to make it very difficult for adversaries to guess URLs, for example https://register.rockthevote.org/pdf/456136972787234.pdf 
One intended use is that the caller embed the URL in a link in dynamically generated HTML that is presented to the user.
The URL is not returned until the URL is valid, with the PDF ready for download
callback is an optional string parameter that, if present and not empty, changes the return value from JSON format to jsonp; that is, the JSON return value would be a string J, and if the callback parameter’s value is F, then the return value will be F(J);

gregistrations

Creates a new registrant record using the input parameter data, for the use case where the user was eligible to finish their registration on a government operated state-specific web site, chose to be re-directed there, and did not return -- presumably because they finished registration on the state’s site.

Differs from registrations only in the following ways:

Only the following parameters are required: lang, partner_id, send_confirmation_reminder_emails, date_of_birth, email_address, home_zip_code,  us_citizen, name_title, last_name
If send_confirmation_reminder_emails is true, then the emails sent are the the emails that are pertinent to this use case, rather than the standard use case of completing a registration using the Rocky UI
The PDF is not generated
Success has no output parameters
There is an additional error return code

POST /api/v2/gregistrations.json

POST { registration: {
See registrations interface definition for fields of “registration” input record
}}

Success: return 200

Unsupported state: return 400
    { message: string }

See registrations interface definition for other return data definitions.





gregistrationstates

Returns a list of state for which Rocky current supports per-state integration with states. There are no input parameters. State return data is the 2 letter code for the state, and the URL to use to send registrant data to the state’s web site.

GET /api/v2/gregistrationstates.json

Success: return 200
{ states: [name: string (2 letter state code), url: string (URL format)] }

state_requirements

Most input fields are personal information; most output fields are indicated as state specific. A few fields merit additional description:

For input, one of home_state_id and home_zip_code is required. If both are provided, they must match. Really only one is needed.
fields named “<foo>_msg” contain a string with state-specific information that explains the state-specific situation of <foo>, such as what the requirements are for reporting race, or stating party affiliation, or why the state does not allow party affiliation, or what the state’s rules are about ID numbers for voter registration, or for minimum age for filing a voter registration application.
fields named “sos_<foo>” refer to the contract information for the office of Secretary of State for the state specified in the home_state_id input field
invalid state error is for a home_state_id input field value that is not a state, e.g. AJ
non participating state error is for a correct state id, but for a state that does not participate in mail-in NVRA-form registration; the explanatory msg is state-specific
to validate the age, make sure the person is 18+ yo and return localized error message if she’s not
no_party_msg is the name of the last option for party affiliation; in some states it is “none” while in others it is “decline to state” and over time any state can change its preferences
requires_party_msg explains the state’s rules for whether an application must or may include a party affiliation selection
callback is an optional string parameter, exactly as described above

GET /api/v2/state_requirements.json checks state eligibility and provides state-specific fields information

GET: { lang: locale-compatible string (en/es, etc),
            home_state_id: string(2),

registrations

For a given partner, checks partner_id (ID in the “partners” table) and corresponding API key, and returns partner-specific registration records. Partner account was created using Rocky web UI; API key was set then, and can be reset later via admin UI. Optional “email” parameter filters the partner’s registration records, to return only those with an email address that matches the address provided in the parameter. Optional “since” parameter limits returned records to those created after the date-time provided as parameter value; the records include those that were started but not completed, and a noted via the “status” out parameter. The callback parameter is an optional string parameter, exactly as described above.

gregistrations

For a given gpartner -- a government partner such as a local elections office -- checks partner_id (ID in the “partners” table) and corresponding API key, and returns partner-specific registration records. Partner account was created by the Rocky admin; API key was set then, and can be reset later by the Rocky admin. The record returned are those records for which the registrant’s ZIP code is one of the ZIP codes associated with the partner_id -- ZIP codes that were set by Rocky admin during creation, and can be updated.

Optional “email” parameter filters the partner’s registration records, to return only those with an email address that matches the address provided in the parameter. Optional “since” parameter limits returned records to those created after the date-time provided as parameter value; the records include those that were started but not completed, and a noted via the “status” out parameter. The callback parameter is an optional string parameter, exactly as described above.
